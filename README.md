## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Modules with [BEM methodology](https://getbem.com/)
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Type-safe JavaScript
- [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) - For state management
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) - For component development and documentation

### What I learned

I had previously used Zustand in a collaborative project, but this was my first time working with it independently. This experience helped me solidify my understanding of its API and how to efficiently manage global states.

Additionally, working with CSS Modules and BEM for styling allowed me to keep the codebase modular and maintainable.

### Continued development

I plan to explore and incorporate unit testing in future projects, and this challenge could be a good starting point for practicing tests with tools like Jest and React Testing Library. This will help me further improve the reliability and maintainability of my code.
